Rust service named `webhook-auto-update` that listens for GitHub package events and dispatches Podman unit upgrades via systemd. It validates HMAC signatures, enforces rate limits, refreshes Podman images, can trigger units manually, and exposes a JSON API plus scheduler loop. Durable state lives under `WEBHOOK_STATE_DIR` (default `/srv/pod-upgrade-trigger`) with SQLite DB in `data/pod-upgrade-trigger.db`, `last_payload.bin`, and optional `web/dist` UI bundle. Source tree contains Rust crate (`src/`), SQL migrations (`migrations/`), tests with mock binaries (`tests/`), docs/systemd assets, and helper data directories.
